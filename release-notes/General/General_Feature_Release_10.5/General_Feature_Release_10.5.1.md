## Highlights

## New features

#### New SLNet call GetProtocolQActionsStateRequestMessage to retrieve QAction compilation warnings and errors [ID 41218]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

A new SLNet call `GetProtocolQActionsStateRequestMessage` can now be used to retrieve the compilation warnings and errors of a given protocol and version. The response, `GetProtocolQActionsStateResponseMessage`, will then contains all faulty QActions and their respective warnings and errors.

In future versions, this call will be used to verify whether DataMiner Swarming can be enabled on a DataMiner System.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner installer has been updated [ID 40409]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

The DataMiner installer has been updated.

For more information on the installer, see [Installing DataMiner using the DataMiner Installer](xref:Installing_DM_using_the_DM_installer).

### Fixes

#### SLElement would leak memory when filtering a recursive table or a directview/view table that had to be sorted [ID 41058]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When SLElement had to process a table filter request, it would leak memory in the following cases:

- When the table had a foreign key to itself.
- When a directview or view table with a number of non-initialized columns had to be sorted.

#### Failover: Problem when an element.xml file was updated while StorageModule was synchronizing its cache [ID 41133]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in a Failover setup, SLDMS was synchronizing an updated *element.xml* file while the StorageModule DcM was synchronizing its cache to an XML file, in some rare cases, an exception could be thrown in the StorageModule DcM, causing the *element.xml* update to fail.

#### LDAP/ActiveDirectory domain users would no longer be able to log in [ID 41143]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

Since DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7, in some cases, LDAP/ActiveDirectory domain users would no longer be able to log in. When such a user tried to log in, the following entry would be added to the SLNet.txt log file:

`Authentication Step Failure: Not a DataMiner user: CONTOSA\user`

This issue would only occur on LDAP servers where `CN=CONTOSA,CN=Partitions,CN=Configuration,DC=contosa,DC=com` does not have a `nETBIOSName` attribute, for example when accessing the GlobalCatalog of a forest.

After having upgraded to a DataMiner version that contains this fix, you can do the following:

- Wait up to an hour for the next LDAP synchronization to occur, or
- Manually trigger the "Skyline DataMiner LDAP Resync" task in Windows Task Scheduler.

All users should then be able to log in again.

#### STaaS: Excessive number of duplicate entries added to the SLErrors.txt log file in case of connection problems [ID 41192]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

On STaaS systems, in case of connection problems, a large number of the following errors would be added to the *SLErrors.txt* log file:

- *The remote name could not be resolved.*
- *Unable to connect to the remote server.*

From now on, in case of connection problems, the generation of *SLErrors.txt* log file entries will be throttled in order to reduce the number of duplicate entries.
